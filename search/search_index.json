These quantum materials hold the key not only to new advanced technologies but also to raise fundamental questions about the microscopic physical world. To understand such systems, it has become increasingly necessary to employ a combination of high-resolution spectroscopies and theoretical modeling of the interplay of spin, charge, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom in parallel to disentangle the rich tapestry of complex properties. </p> <p>This two-week summer school aims to expose students to modern and emerging theoretical and experimental techniques, as well as their application to problems in the physical sciences and engineering. Lectures will be pedagogical, covering (i) the background quantum mechanical and many-body theory necessary to understand modern computational methods, (ii) introduce emerging material informatics and ML/AI tools, and (iii) in-depth tutorials on key experimental techniques, along with their theoretical underpinnings. Topics will be presented in a logical sequence to ensure all students are on the same footing. Extensive hands-on training using open-source codes will be an integral part of the school. Additionally, the students will visit three user facilities to show how the techniques learned in the classroom translate to real scientific problems. </p> <p>This school is open to both theoretical and experimental science students who have completed at least one year of graduate work and are familiar with advanced quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. Each student will have the opportunity to present their work to encourage in-depth discussion. Questions are encouraged, free time and hands-on sessions give ample time for students to interact with Faculty and with each other. This school will help train the next generation of researchers to use and develop these tools and methods in their own research programs. </p> <p>Registration is required for non-LANL participants who will receive travel, room, and board.</p> <p></p> <p>All LANL students, postdocs, and staff who are currently on-site do not need to register and are welcome to attend the entire two-week program or individual lectures/hands-on sessions of interest.</p>"},{"location":"#important-dates","title":"Important Dates:","text":"Date Application open December 1, 2025 Application deadline January 18, 2026 Application window is closed.
